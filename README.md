# Simulated Adversary Phishing Awareness Campaign Using GoPhish & Mailtrap on macOS

A comprehensive project simulating phishing attacks using GoPhish and Mailtrap on macOS in a safe, fully sandboxed environment. Designed to mimic real-world adversary techniques for awareness training and security evaluation.

## Features

- End-to-end phishing simulation workflow: design, deployment, tracking, analysis  
- Realistic phishing email and landing page templates  
- Secure email delivery sandboxing with Mailtrap  
- Detailed metrics collection: email opens, clicks, data submissions  
- Ethical and responsible self-targeted campaign execution  
- Post-simulation analysis to provide actionable security awareness feedback  

## Installation

1. Install [GoPhish](https://getgophish.com/) from its official site or repository.  
2. Set up a Mailtrap account and configure SMTP settings for sandboxed email delivery.  
3. Configure GoPhish with Mailtrap SMTP credentials on macOS.  
4. Create phishing email and landing page templates inside GoPhish.  
5. Launch campaigns targeting yourself in a controlled environment.  
6. Track campaign metrics and analyze results using the GoPhish dashboard.  

## Usage

- Prepare targeted phishing email templates that mimic common adversary techniques.  
- Use Mailtrap to safely capture and sandbox emails to prevent real-world delivery.  
- Run phishing campaigns using GoPhish and monitor engagement metrics.  
- Analyze collected metrics for insights into user behavior and campaign effectiveness.  
- Incorporate learning outcomes into security awareness training and policy design.  

## Requirements

- macOS operating system  
- GoPhish phishing framework  
- Mailtrap email sandbox account  
- Basic knowledge of phishing techniques & cybersecurity concepts  

## Outcomes

- Hands-on experience designing and launching simulated phishing attacks.  
- Understanding attacker and defender perspectives in adversary simulation.  
- Improved skills in crafting emails, metrics analysis, and security awareness.  
- Experience with ethical, legal, and responsible simulation processes.
